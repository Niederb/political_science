Manual preprocessing
All the files were preprocessed manually. The columns
were standardized such that all files have the same columns.
Some empty lines were deleted. 
- The column headers were standardized
- Copyright and contact information at the end of each file was removed
- Statistics from Swiss people living abroad (Auslandschweizer was also removed)
